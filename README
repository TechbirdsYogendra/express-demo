What we have learned in this app:

1. Setting up an Express.js application:
   - Installed and configured Express.js to create a web server.
   - Used middleware like `express.json()` and `express.static()`.

2. Creating RESTful APIs:
   - Implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for managing courses.
   - Used route parameters to handle dynamic URLs (e.g., `/api/courses/:id`).

3. Validating Input:
   - Used the `Joi` library to validate user input.
   - Ensured proper error handling for invalid data with `400 Bad Request`.

4. Error Handling:
   - Sent consistent JSON responses for `404 Not Found` and `400 Bad Request` errors.
   - Created a reusable helper function for error responses.

5. Serving Static Files:
   - Configured the `public` directory to serve static files like `index.html` and `courses.html`.

6. Dynamic Content Rendering:
   - Used JavaScript in `courses.html` to fetch and display data dynamically from the `/api/courses` endpoint.

7. Linking HTML Pages:
   - Linked `index.html` with `courses.html` to navigate between the home screen and the courses list.

8. Best Practices:
   - Followed RESTful API design principles.
   - Used proper HTTP status codes for responses.
   - Maintained clean and modular code for better readability and maintainability.

9. Running the Application:
   - Used `npm` to manage dependencies.
   - Started the server and tested the application on `http://localhost:3000/`.

This app demonstrates the basics of building a full-stack application with Express.js, including backend API development and frontend integration.
